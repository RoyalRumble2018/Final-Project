## Kidney Disease

* [liver_disease.csv](https://github.com/RoyalRumble2018/Final-Project/blob/master/Liver%20Disease/liver_disease.csv) is the csv which which we are using in our model.

* [EDA](https://github.com/RoyalRumble2018/Final-Project/blob/master/Liver%20Disease/EDA.ipynb) consists of code of Exploratory Data Analysis.

* [Data Cleaning](https://github.com/RoyalRumble2018/Final-Project/blob/master/Liver%20Disease/Data%20Cleaning.ipynb) contains data and code which is used to remove all missing data from our dataset. 

* [liver1.csv](https://github.com/RoyalRumble2018/Final-Project/blob/master/Liver%20Disease/liver1.csv) is the final dataset which we got after data cleaning and this is the model which we are going to use from now onwards.

* [Algorithm before feature selection](https://github.com/RoyalRumble2018/Final-Project/blob/master/Liver%20Disease/Algorithms%20before%20feature%20selection.ipynb) contains list of all the `algorithms` which is used in our model.

* [Summary.csv](https://github.com/RoyalRumble2018/Final-Project/blob/master/Liver%20Disease/Summary.csv) is the `summary metrics ` which we got after running algorithms before doing feature analysis.

* [Feature Selection](https://github.com/RoyalRumble2018/Final-Project/blob/master/Liver%20Disease/Feature%20Selection.ipynb) - Feature selection is done to remove less important features.

* [Algorithm after feature selection](https://github.com/RoyalRumble2018/Final-Project/blob/master/Liver%20Disease/Algorithms%20after%20feature%20selection.ipynb) - After feature selection is performed, we are removing less important features from our dataset and running the model again.
